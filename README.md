# VMPS: Musica's VTOL Mission Planning Software

**Note for Alpha Releases:** When you create a new campaign, it will be placed in your temp folder.

## How to Use

### 1. Seed Your VTOL VR Campaign
- Go to `File > New Campaign...`
- Enter a campaign name, then select the folder in VTOL VR for an existing campaign.
  - **Note:** Campaigns must first be seeded with at least 1 unit and 1 static object for the tool to work properly.

### 2. Open the Seeded Campaign
- Go to `File > Open Campaign...`
- In your temp folder, there should be a folder labeled `campaigns`
- Open the `campaigns` folder, then open the campaign name that you previously seeded.
  - It should look like `[insert_name_here].campaign`

### 3. Select a Scenario
- Click the `Choose Scenario...` button in the bottom left corner of VMPS.
- Select the `Scenario.vts` file you'd like to begin working on.

### 4. Select a Map
- Click the `Choose Map...` button in VMPS.
- The map button will allow you to right-click and place templates on the map once they've been imported.

### 5. Import Templates
- Click the `Import Templates` button in VMPS.
- Use the `templates.zip` file in releases as an example for your templates.
  - Extract the `templates.zip` file to a folder.
- When you click `Import Templates`, select the folder that the templates were extracted to.
  - When that folder is selected, all templates in that folder will be imported. (This allows you to use the folders like palettes).

### 6. Place Templates
- Right-click on the map > `Template` > [select your template]
- Alternatively, use the `Unit -> Template` button **(preferred method)**.
- Place as many templates as you want using the above methods.

### 7. Save Your Scenario
- When ready to save your `Scenario.vts` file, go to `File > Save As...` or `File > Save`.

## Notes
- In this early alpha build, you must have at least one unit and one static object in the scenario that you're copying templates to.

**Happy Hunting!**
