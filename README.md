# VMPS
 Musica's VTOL Mission Planning Software

For alpha releases, keep in mind that when you create a new campaign it will be placed in your temp folder.

# How to use:

1. Seed your VTOL VR Campaign
   - File > New Campaign...
   - Enter campaign name, then select the folder in VTOL VR for an existing campaign.
   - NOTE: Campaigns must first be seeded with 1 unit and 1 static object for the tool to work properly.
2. Open the seeded campaign
   - File > Open Campaign...
   - In your temp folder, there should be a folder labeled 'campaigns'
   - Open the 'campaigns' folder, then open the campaign name that you previously seeded
       - It should look like '[insert_name_here].campaign
3. Click the Choose Scenario... button in the bottom left corner of VMPS.
   - Select whichever Scenario.vts you'd like to begin working on.
5. Click the Choose Map... button in VMPS.
   - The choose map button will allow you to right-click and place templates on the map once they've been imported.
6. Click the Import Templates button in VMPS.
   - Use the templates.zip file in releases as an example for what your templates should look like
   - Extract the templates.zip file to a folder.
   - When you click Import Templates, select the folder that the templates were extracted to.
   - When that folder is selected, all templates in that folder will be imported. (This allows you to use the folders like palettes).
7. Place your templates using right-click > template > [select your template]
8. Alternatively, place templates using the Unit -> Template button (preferred method).
9. Place as many templates as you want using steps 7 & 8.
10. When ready to save your Scenario.vts file, use File > Save As... OR File > Save



# NOTES:
- In this early alpha build, you must have at least one unit, and one static object in scenario that you're copying templates to.
